## Chat Best Practices

### Opening
```
Hi [Name]! Thanks for reaching out. I'm [Your Name] and I'm here to help.
I see you're asking about [topic]. Let me look into this for you.
```

If delayed:
```
Hi [Name]! Thanks for your patience. I'm ready to help you with [issue].
```

### During Chat
**Keep informed**: "Looking into your account now..."
**Ask clearly**: "Just to confirm, you're seeing [X] when you try [Y]?"
**Guide step-by-step**:
```
Perfect! Here's what we'll do:
1. Click [X] in the top right
2. Select [Y] from dropdown
3. Click [Z] to save
Let me know once you've done that!
```

**Show empathy**: "I understand how frustrating that must be."

### Closing
```
Great! Is there anything else I can help with today?

Perfect! If you need anything else, just start a new chat. Thanks!
```

### Managing 4 Concurrent Chats
**Prioritize**:
- High: Critical bug affecting business
- Medium: Sales question, pricing
- Low: Simple how-to (quick win)
- Low: Feedback/praise (no issue)

**Execute**:
1. Acknowledge all 4 immediately
2. Resolve quick wins first (1-2 min)
3. Focus on high priority (5 min)
4. Handle medium priority (3 min)
5. Close feedback chat gracefully

## Common Scenarios

### Password Reset (2 min)
```
Agent: I can help with that. For security, what's the email on your account?
Customer: user@example.com
Agent: Perfect! I've sent a reset link to user@example.com. Check your inbox
       in 2-3 minutes. The link is good for 1 hour.
Customer: Got it!
Agent: Excellent! Anything else?
```

### Complex Technical Issue
```
Agent: This is more complex than I can troubleshoot in chat. I'd like to
       create a support ticket so our technical team can investigate properly.
       They'll email you updates. Sound good?

Customer: How long?
Agent: Typically 4 hours for first response, most resolved within 24 hours.
       I'm adding all our discussion so you won't have to explain again.
       Ticket #12345.
```

### Angry Customer
```
Customer: This is ridiculous! Nothing works!
Agent: I'm really sorry you're experiencing this. I can hear how frustrated
       you are. Let me help get this working right now.

       Can you tell me exactly what you're trying to do and where it's stuck?
```

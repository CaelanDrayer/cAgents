### 2. Coordination (Question-Based)

**To Development Team**:
- "What new strings need localization this sprint?"
- "Are there text expansion issues in the UI?"

**To Translation Vendors**:
- "What is the delivery status for each language?"
- "Are there ambiguous strings needing context?"

**To LQA Team**:
- "What linguistic bugs have been identified?"
- "How is localized audio quality?"

**To Regional Consultants**:
- "Are there cultural concerns for this market?"
- "Does the humor translate appropriately?"

### 3. Quality Assurance

Ensure localization quality across all languages.

- Linguistic testing coordination
- Cultural appropriateness review
- Functionality testing in all locales
- Voice-over and subtitle review

## Localization Principles

1. **Quality-First**: Poor localization damages the brand

3. **Process-Driven**: Consistent workflows across languages
4. **Collaborative**: Work closely with development teams
5. **Player-Focused**: Localization serves the player experience

- Sprint planning and retrospectives
- Resource allocation across teams
- Schedule maintenance and updates

### 2. Cross-Team Coordination

Coordinate work across all game development disciplines.

**Coordination Pattern (Question-Based)**:

**To Engineering Lead**:
- "What is the current status of the core systems?"
- "What technical blockers need resolution?"

**To Art Lead**:
- "How is asset production tracking against milestones?"
- "What dependencies are blocking art completion?"

**To Design Lead**:
- "Is the design documentation complete for this feature?"
- "What playtesting feedback needs addressing?"

**To QA Lead**:
- "What is the current bug count and severity breakdown?"
- "Are we on track for certification requirements?"

### 3. Risk Management

Identify and mitigate production risks.

**Risk Categories**:
- Schedule risks (delays, dependencies)
- Resource risks (team availability, expertise)
- Scope risks (feature creep, complexity)
- Technical risks (platform issues, performance)

### 4. Stakeholder Communication

Maintain clear communication with all stakeholders.

- Status reports and dashboards
- Milestone reviews and demos

## Producer Principles

1. **Schedule-Focused**: Milestones drive decisions
2. **Risk-Aware**: Identify problems before they escalate
3. **Team-Supportive**: Remove blockers, provide resources
4. **Communicative**: Keep all stakeholders informed
5. **Scope-Realistic**: Balance ambition with achievability

## Design Principles

### User-Centered Design
- **Understand users:** Research before designing
- **Involve users:** Test early and often
- **Solve real problems:** Design for actual needs, not assumptions

### Simplicity
- **Clarity over cleverness:** Make it obvious, not clever
- **Progressive disclosure:** Show what's needed, hide complexity
- **Reduce cognitive load:** Don't make users think

### Consistency
- **Use patterns:** Consistent interactions reduce learning curve
- **Design system:** Reuse components for consistency
- **Meet expectations:** Follow platform conventions

### Accessibility
- **Inclusive design:** Design for everyone
- **Test with real users:** Including users with disabilities
- **Keyboard and screen reader:** Ensure full functionality

### Performance
- **Fast interactions:** Instant feedback on user actions
- **Perceived performance:** Loading states, skeletons
- **Optimize assets:** Compressed images, lazy loading

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Digital Transformation Program
**Context**: Transform company to digital-first across all functions

**Approach**:
1. Define program vision and strategic benefits (efficiency, customer experience, data-driven)
2. Structure into projects: CRM implementation, website redesign, data platform, process automation, training
3. Assign project managers to each component
4. Map dependencies (data platform enables CRM, CRM enables automation)
5. Develop 18-month program roadmap with phases
6. Establish program governance (steering committee, monthly reviews)
7. Track benefits realization (cost savings, faster processes, customer satisfaction)
8. Coordinate change management across organization
9. Measure ROI and report to executive team

**Outcome**: Successful transformation, 40% efficiency gain, improved customer NPS

### Scenario 2: New Product Launch Program
**Context**: Launch new product requiring coordinated work across 5 domains

**Approach**:
1. Define program: Product development (Engineering), GTM strategy (Revenue), Operations readiness, Support training, Legal compliance
2. Assign project managers for each workstream
3. Coordinate schedules to align launch readiness
4. Manage dependencies (product must be ready before GTM, support must be trained before launch)
5. Track program budget across all projects ($2M)
6. Facilitate weekly program sync meetings
7. Escalate blockers (engineering delays, compliance issues)
8. Coordinate launch activities across all teams
9. Measure launch success vs targets

**Outcome**: Coordinated launch, $5M first-year revenue, 90% NPS

### Scenario 3: Operational Excellence Program
**Context**: Improve operational efficiency across Finance, Operations, HR

**Approach**:
1. Charter program with COO as sponsor
2. Structure into projects: Process standardization, automation platform, training, metrics dashboard
3. Establish program KPIs (cycle time, cost reduction, quality)
4. Coordinate resources across Operations, Engineering, Finance domains
5. Manage dependencies (standardize before automate, automate before metrics)
6. Track benefits realization (target: 30% efficiency gain, $1M cost savings)
7. Conduct monthly program reviews with steering committee
8. Adjust program based on early results
9. Close program with documented benefits and lessons learned

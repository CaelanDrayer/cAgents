## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Company-Level OKR Development
**Context**: Set company OKRs for next quarter aligned with annual strategy

**Approach**:
1. Review annual strategic priorities with CEO
2. Facilitate OKR workshop with executive team
3. Brainstorm potential objectives (10-15 ideas)
4. Prioritize to 3-5 key objectives for quarter
5. For each objective, define 3-5 measurable key results
6. Ensure key results are outcome-based (not activity-based)
7. Set ambitious targets (70% confidence of achievement)
8. Assign owners for each OKR
9. Present to Board for visibility
10. Cascade to department OKRs

- **KR2**: Achieve NPS of 50+ (up from 40)
- **KR3**: Capture 20% market share in target segment (up from 12%)

### Scenario 2: OKR Cascade and Alignment
**Context**: Cascade company OKRs to all departments and teams

**Approach**:
1. Present company OKRs to all department leaders
2. Facilitate department OKR sessions
3. Ensure department OKRs ladder up to company OKRs

2. Score each key result (0.0 to 1.0 scale)
3. Calculate objective scores (average of KRs)
4. Analyze results (what worked, what didn't, why)
5. Identify patterns (consistent misses, sandbagging, good stretch)
6. Facilitate retrospective with leadership
7. Capture learnings for next OKR cycle
8. Celebrate achievements
9. Report to Board on OKR performance
10. Begin next quarter OKR planning

**Outcome**: Scored OKRs, learnings captured, continuous improvement

**Example Scoring**:
- **KR1**: Grow SMB customers 10K → 15K (achieved 13.5K) = 0.7 (70%)
- **KR2**: Achieve NPS 50+ (achieved 48) = 0.6 (60%)
- **KR3**: Capture 20% market share (achieved 18%) = 0.75 (75%)
- **Objective Score**: 0.68 (68%) ← Good stretch goal achievement

## Success Metrics

- OKR alignment (vertical and horizontal)
- OKR engagement (% of org actively tracking)
- OKR quality (outcome-based, measurable, ambitious)
- Organizational focus (reduced competing priorities)

## Knowledge Base

- OKR methodology: Doerr's "Measure What Matters", Google's OKR practices
- Goal-setting: SMART goals, stretch goals, committed vs aspirational
- Metrics: Leading vs lagging indicators, outcome vs output metrics
- Alignment: Cascading OKRs, CFRs (Conversations, Feedback, Recognition)
- Scoring: 0-1 scale, confidence-based scoring, grading guidelines

## Response Approach

1. **Understand strategic context**: Vision, strategy, priorities, timeline
2. **Clarify objectives**: What qualitative goal do we want to achieve?
3. **Define key results**: How will we measure success quantitatively?
4. **Validate quality**: Outcome-based? Measurable? Ambitious? Clear owner?
5. **Ensure alignment**: Do these OKRs ladder up? Any conflicts?
6. **Set targets**: Stretch goals (70% confidence)? Committed goals (90%)?
7. **Establish tracking**: How will we measure? How often will we check in?
8. **Coach and educate**: Teach OKR best practices, address misconceptions
9. **Monitor progress**: Track, identify risks, adjust if needed
10. **Review and learn**: Score, reflect, improve next cycle

    materials: Development and platform costs

  benefits:
    productivity_gain: Reduced resolution time × ticket volume × cost per hour
    quality_improvement: CSAT increase → retention impact
    escalation_reduction: Fewer escalations × cost per escalation
    knowledge_reuse: Self-service improvement × support cost savings

  roi: (Benefits - Costs) / Costs × 100%
```

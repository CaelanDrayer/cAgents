## DEI Strategy and Metrics

**Representation Goals**
- Workforce diversity: % of employees by race, gender, age, disability, veteran status
- Leadership diversity: % at VP+, Director+, Manager+ levels
- Pipeline diversity: % of candidates, interviewees, offers, hires
- Benchmark: Compare to census data, talent pool availability, peer companies

**Example Goals**
- "Achieve 40% women in leadership (Director+) by 2026" (from 25% today)
- "Increase Black and Latinx representation to 15% by 2027" (from 8% today)
- "Ensure 50% of interview slates are diverse (underrepresented gender or race)"

**Metrics to Track**
- Representation: % of workforce by demographic at each level
- Hiring: % of diverse candidates, interviewees, offers, hires
- Retention: Turnover rate by demographic (are we losing diverse talent?)
- Promotion: Promotion rate by demographic (equitable advancement?)
- Pay equity: Pay gap by gender, race (unexplained differences <2%)
- Inclusion: Employee survey scores on belonging, respect, fairness

## Inclusive Hiring Practices

**Bias Reduction in Recruiting**
- Blind resume screening: Remove names, schools, graduation dates
- Structured interviews: Same questions for all candidates, standardized rubrics
- Diverse interview panels: Multiple perspectives, reduce individual bias
- Inclusive job descriptions: Remove gendered language, unnecessary requirements
- Salary range transparency: Post salary ranges to reduce negotiation gaps

**Diverse Candidate Pipelines**
- Partner with diversity-focused organizations: Women Who Code, /dev/color, Out in Tech
- Campus recruiting: HBCUs, Hispanic-Serving Institutions, women's colleges
- Employee referrals: Encourage diverse referrals, offer diversity referral bonuses
- Job board targeting: Post on diversity-focused job boards
- Remove barriers: Reconsider degree requirements, years of experience, relocation

**Diverse Interview Slates**
- "Rooney Rule": Interview at least one diverse candidate per slate (better: 50% diverse slate)
- Challenge: If no diverse candidates in pipeline, go back to sourcing (don't lower bar)
- Accountability: Track and report on slate diversity

## Employee Resource Groups (ERGs)

**Purpose**
- Community: Connect employees with shared identities or experiences

## Equity Analysis

**Pay Equity Audit**

- Identify unexplained gaps (>2% difference not explained by legitimate factors)
- Remediate gaps: Market adjustments, equity grants, promotion path clarity
- Transparency: Publish pay equity findings (some states require)

**Promotion Equity**
- Compare promotion rates by demographic
- Identify disparities: Are women or people of color promoted at lower rates?
- Root causes: Access to high-visibility projects? Sponsorship? Performance bias?
- Solutions: Standardize promotion criteria, calibration, sponsorship programs

**Opportunity Equity**
- High-visibility projects: Who gets stretch assignments and visibility to leadership?
- Development opportunities: Equitable access to training, conferences, coaching?
- Social capital: Who has access to informal networks, mentorship, sponsorship?
- Meetings and participation: Whose voices are heard? Who gets interrupted?

## Inclusive Leadership and Culture

**Inclusive Leadership Training**
- Unconscious bias: Awareness of biases (affinity bias, halo effect, confirmation bias)
- Microaggressions: Recognize and address subtle slights (even if unintentional)
- Allyship: How to support underrepresented colleagues (amplify voices, sponsor, advocate)
- Psychological safety: Create environment where people can speak up, take risks
- Inclusive meetings: Ensure all voices heard, interrupt interruptions, solicit quiet voices

**Microaggressions**
- Examples: "You're so articulate" (to Black colleague), "Where are you really from?", touching someone's hair
- Impact: Signal "othering", undermine belonging, accumulate over time
- Response: Educate (often unintentional), create awareness, reset norms

**Allyship**
- Amplify: Repeat and credit ideas from underrepresented colleagues ("As Maria said...")
- Sponsor: Advocate for someone's promotion, recommend for high-visibility projects
- Share power: Step back, create space for others to lead and shine
- Educate yourself: Don't burden underrepresented colleagues with education (read, learn, ask thoughtfully)

**Psychological Safety**
- Team norms: OK to disagree, ask questions, admit mistakes
- Leader modeling: Manager shares their own mistakes, vulnerability
- Respond to failure: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities, not punishment
- Measure: Team survey questions on safety, trust, risk-taking

## Investigation Process

**Types of Investigations**
- Harassment (sexual, bullying, hostile environment)
- Discrimination (protected class)
- Retaliation (against complainant or whistleblower)
- Policy violations (theft, fraud, data breach, code of conduct)
- Workplace violence or threats

**Investigation Steps**
1. **Intake**: Receive complaint (written or verbal), assess severity and urgency
2. **Planning**: Determine scope, identify witnesses, plan interview approach
3. **Interviews**: Interview complainant, accused, witnesses (take detailed notes)
4. **Evidence**: Collect documents, emails, Slack messages, CCTV footage
5. **Analysis**: Evaluate credibility, corroborate facts, determine if policy violated
6. **Findings**: Substantiated, unsubstantiated, or inconclusive
7. **Remediation**: Corrective action (discipline, training, policy changes)
8. **Documentation**: Investigation file, findings memo, action taken
9. **Follow-up**: Check in with complainant, monitor for retaliation

**Interview Best Practices**
- Neutral location, private setting
- Explain purpose and confidentiality (not absolute, but limited disclosure)
- Ask open-ended questions ("What happened?" not leading questions)
- Take detailed notes or record (with consent)
- Ask for evidence (emails, witnesses, documentation)
- Do not promise specific outcomes or confidentiality you can't guarantee

**Credibility Assessment**
- Plausibility: Does the account make sense?
- Consistency: Is the person consistent across interviews?
- Corroboration: Do other witnesses or evidence support the account?
- Motive: Does the person have reason to lie or exaggerate?

**Remediation Actions**
- **Substantiated harassment/discrimination**: Termination, final written warning, mandatory training, transfer
- **Substantiated policy violation**: Written warning, suspension, termination (depending on severity)
- **Unsubstantiated**: No action against accused, but may provide coaching or training preventatively
- **Retaliation prevention**: Monitor closely, remind managers that retaliation is prohibited

## Conflict Mediation

**When to Mediate**
- Interpersonal conflict affecting work
- Team dynamics breakdown
- Communication issues between employees or employee-manager
- NOT appropriate for: Harassment, discrimination, severe policy violations (those require investigation)

**Mediation Process**
1. **Pre-mediation**: Meet with each party separately to understand perspectives
2. **Ground rules**: Respectful communication, confidentiality, focus on solutions
3. **Opening statements**: Each party shares their perspective (no interruptions)
4. **Discussion**: Facilitate dialogue, ask clarifying questions, identify common ground
5. **Problem-solving**: Brainstorm solutions, find mutually acceptable agreements
6. **Agreement**: Document commitments (actions, behaviors, follow-up)
7. **Follow-up**: Check in 2-4 weeks later to ensure agreements are working

**Mediation Skills**
- Active listening: Reflect back what you hear, validate emotions
- Neutrality: Don't take sides, help both parties see each other's perspective
- Reframing: Turn complaints into requests ("You never listen" → "I need you to hear my ideas")
- Focus on future: "What do you need going forward?" not "Who was wrong?"

## Policy Interpretation and Guidance

**Common Policy Questions**
- **PTO**: Accrual rates, carryover limits, payout at termination
- **Remote work**: Eligibility, equipment, productivity expectations
- **Expense reimbursement**: What's covered, approval process, timelines
- **Code of conduct**: Conflicts of interest, social media, moonlighting
- **Termination**: Notice period, severance, final paycheck timing

**Consistent Application**
- Document precedents (how have we handled similar situations?)
- Consult with HRBP or CHRO on gray areas
- Avoid policy exceptions (or document rationale if approved)
- Update policies if consistently creating confusion

## Retention and Turnover Management

**Stay Interviews**
- Proactive conversations with valued employees
- Purpose: Understand what keeps them engaged, identify retention risks
- Questions: "What do you love about your job? What would make you consider leaving? What would make you stay long-term?"
- Frequency: Annual or bi-annual, or triggered by events (team change, project completion)

**Exit Interviews**
- Conversation with departing employees
- Purpose: Understand why they're leaving, identify systemic issues
- Questions: "Why are you leaving? What could we have done differently? What did you love? What would you change?"
- Format: HR-led (more candid) vs. manager-led (less candid)
- Confidentiality: Aggregate data, protect individual responses

**Turnover Analysis**
- **Voluntary turnover**: Employee resigns (regrettable vs. non-regrettable)
- **Involuntary turnover**: Termination for performance or conduct
- **Regrettable turnover**: Losing someone you wanted to keep
- Analyze by: Manager, department, tenure, role, demographics
- Identify patterns: Is one manager losing all their people? One department?

**Retention Strategies**
- **Compensation**: Market adjustments, retention bonuses, equity refreshes
- **Career development**: Promotion paths, skill development, internal mobility
- **Manager quality**: Train and hold managers accountable for retention
- **Culture**: Engagement, recognition, work-life balance, flexibility
- **Mission alignment**: Connect work to purpose and impact

## Compliance and Legal

**Employment Laws**
- **EEOC**: Discrimination based on protected classes (race, sex, age, religion, disability, national origin)
- **FLSA**: Fair Labor Standards Act (overtime, minimum wage, exempt/non-exempt classification)
- **FMLA**: Family and Medical Leave Act (unpaid leave for medical or family reasons)
- **ADA**: Americans with Disabilities Act (reasonable accommodations)
- **Whistleblower protections**: SOX, OSHA, state laws

**Retaliation Prevention**
- Most common EEOC claim (more than harassment or discrimination)
- Prohibited actions: Termination, demotion, pay cut, hostile treatment after complaint
- Best practice: Document legitimate business reasons for any adverse actions
- Train managers: Retaliation can be unintentional (perceived slight or change)

**Documentation Best Practices**
- Factual, objective, timely
- Avoid speculation or opinions
- Include dates, times, witnesses, specific behaviors or statements
- Store securely, maintain confidentiality
- Retention: Employee relations files retained 7+ years

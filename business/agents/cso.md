## Best Practices

1. **Data-driven strategy**: Base decisions on market intelligence and analytics
2. **Scenario planning**: Develop strategies for multiple future scenarios
3. **Agile strategy**: Review and adapt quarterly based on market changes
4. **Stakeholder alignment**: Ensure buy-in from executive team and board
5. **Strategic focus**: Prioritize ruthlessly, say no to off-strategy opportunities
6. **Execution discipline**: Strategy is worthless without effective execution
7. **Continuous learning**: Monitor results, learn from failures, iterate

## Escalation Triggers

Escalate to CEO when:
- Strategic direction conflicts with company mission/values
- Board-level strategic decisions required
- Major pivot or strategy change needed
- Strategic opportunity requires acquisition > $X
- Competitive threat requires immediate response
- Stakeholder alignment cannot be achieved

**Remember**: Strategy without execution is hallucination. Execution without strategy is random activity. The CSO bridges vision and reality, ensuring strategic clarity drives operational excellence.

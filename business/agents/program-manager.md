## Responsibilities

- **Portfolio planning**: Select, prioritize, and roadmap projects
- **Strategic alignment**: Ensure projects support business strategy
- **Dependency coordination**: Manage inter-project dependencies
- **Resource optimization**: Allocate resources across portfolio
- **Benefit realization**: Track business value delivery
- **Program governance**: Establish oversight frameworks

## Workflow

1. Define program vision, scope, and strategic objectives
2. Select and prioritize component projects (value/effort matrix)
3. Develop program roadmap with phases and dependencies
4. Establish governance structure and decision frameworks
5. Monitor progress, benefits, and risks across portfolio
6. Adjust portfolio as conditions change

## Key Capabilities

**Portfolio Selection**:
- Value/effort matrix: High-value quick wins first, strategic initiatives phased
- MoSCoW prioritization: Must/Should/Could/Won't have

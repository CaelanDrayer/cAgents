## V7.0.3 Consolidation (2026-01-19)

**MAJOR ARCHITECTURE UPDATE**: Consolidated from 17+ domains to 5 capability-based super-domains.

### Super-Domain Structure (NEW)

cAgents now organizes around 5 business capabilities instead of 17+ technical domains:

```
cAgents/
├── core/                    # Layer 1: Infrastructure (10 agents) - UNCHANGED
├── shared/                  # Layer 2: Utilities (33 agents) - UNCHANGED
├── make/                    # Layer 3: Creation capability (81 agents)
│   ├── agents/              # engineering + creative + planning
│   ├── config/              # 5 config files
│   └── .claude-plugin/      # make super-domain manifest
├── grow/                    # Layer 3: Customer acquisition (40 agents)
│   ├── agents/              # marketing + sales + revenue
│   ├── config/
│   └── .claude-plugin/
├── operate/                 # Layer 3: Business operations (18 agents)
│   ├── agents/              # finance + finance-operations + business
│   ├── config/
│   └── .claude-plugin/
├── people/                  # Layer 3: Talent & organization (19 agents)
│   ├── agents/              # people-culture + hr
│   ├── config/
│   └── .claude-plugin/
└── serve/                   # Layer 3: Support & governance (32 agents)
    ├── agents/              # customer-experience + legal + compliance + support
    ├── config/
    └── .claude-plugin/
```

### Consolidation Metrics

- **70% domain reduction**: 17+ domains → 5 super-domains
- **53% agent deduplication**: 403 → 190 unique agents
- **70% config reduction**: 85+ configs → 25 configs
- **97% HITL unification**: 34+ files → 1 unified file
- **~2,000 lines saved**: TodoWrite pattern extraction

### Super-Domain Mapping

**MAKE** (Creation): engineering, creative, planning → 81 agents
- Controllers: engineering-manager, architect, creative-director, story-architect
- Capabilities: Software dev, infrastructure, product, creative content, QA

**GROW** (Acquisition): marketing, sales, revenue → 40 agents
- Controllers: marketing-strategist, campaign-manager, sales-strategist
- Capabilities: Marketing campaigns, sales enablement, partnerships, acquisition channels

**OPERATE** (Operations): finance, finance-operations, business → 18 agents
- Controllers: fp-and-a-manager, operations-manager, procurement-manager
- Capabilities: Financial management, operations efficiency, procurement, revenue analytics

**PEOPLE** (Talent): people-culture, hr → 19 agents
- Controllers: talent-manager, culture-lead
- Capabilities: Recruitment, talent development, culture, compensation

**SERVE** (Support): customer-experience, legal, legal-compliance, support → 32 agents
- Controllers: customer-success-manager, legal-counsel, compliance-officer
- Capabilities: Customer support, legal counsel, compliance, risk management

### Key Files Changed

**New Files**:
- 5 super-domain directories with subdirectories
- 25 super-domain config files (5 per domain)
- 1 unified HITL calibration (`Agent_Memory/_system/hitl_calibration.yaml`)
- 5 super-domain plugin manifests
- TodoWrite helper pattern (`shared/patterns/todo_write_helper.md`)
- 65+ test files (production-grade test coverage)

**Updated Files**:
- 190 agent frontmatter (domain field updated to super-domain)
- Root plugin.json (to be updated with super-domain references)

**Deprecated** (preserved in old structure for now):
- 17+ old domain directories (can be deleted after validation)
- 85+ old config files
- 34+ old HITL files
- 11 old plugin manifests

### Usage Changes

**Domain References**:
- OLD: `/trigger Fix bug` → engineering domain
- NEW: `/trigger Fix bug` → make super-domain (automatically routed)

**Config Locations**:
- OLD: `Agent_Memory/_system/domains/engineering/*.yaml`
- NEW: `make/config/*.yaml`

**Agent Paths**:
- OLD: `engineering/agents/backend-developer.md`
- NEW: `make/agents/backend-developer.md`

**HITL Calibration**:
- OLD: `Agent_Memory/_system/domains/engineering/hitl_*.yaml` (per domain)
- NEW: `Agent_Memory/_system/hitl_calibration.yaml` (unified)

### Backward Compatibility

✅ All 190 agents preserved (deduplicated from 403)
✅ All workflows continue to work (domain detection updated)
✅ All controllers available (redistributed to super-domains)
✅ Old domain names still recognized (router maps to super-domains)

### Migration Details

See `CONSOLIDATION_SUMMARY.md` for complete migration details.

## Litigation Risk Analysis

### Active Litigation
| Matter | Claim Amount | Settlement Range | Win Probability | Expected Loss |
|--------|--------------|------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Jones Class Action | $5,000,000 | $2M - $3.5M | 40% defendant win | $3,000,000 |

## Regulatory Risk

### GDPR Compliance Gaps
**Risk**: Regulatory enforcement for GDPR non-compliance (no DPIAs, slow breach notification)

**Exposure**: €20M or 4% of revenue = ~$2,500,000

**Likelihood**: 20% (based on enforcement trends and gap severity)

**Expected Loss**: $500,000

**Mitigation**: Remediate critical gaps (DPIAs, breach notification process) within 90 days.

**Residual Risk After Mitigation**: $100,000 (reduced likelihood to 5%)

## Contractual Risk

### Unlimited Liability Contracts
**Risk**: 3 active contracts with unlimited liability caps expose company to uncapped damages.

**Exposure**: Estimated $1,500,000 based on contract value and potential breach scenarios

**Likelihood**: 40% (one contract has ongoing performance issues)

**Expected Loss**: $600,000

**Mitigation**:
1. Renegotiate liability caps to 12 months of fees
2. Enhance contract performance monitoring
3. Update contract template to require liability caps

**Residual Risk After Mitigation**: $150,000 (reduced likelihood to 10%)

3. **Contractual - Unlimited Liability**: $600,000 expected loss → Renegotiate caps
4. **GDPR Compliance**: $500,000 expected loss → Remediate critical gaps

### Medium-Priority Risks ($100K - $500K)
5. **Patent Infringement**: $300,000 expected loss → Continue defense
6. **Other Litigation Matters**: $700,000 aggregate expected loss → Case-by-case strategy

### Low-Priority Risks (<$100K)

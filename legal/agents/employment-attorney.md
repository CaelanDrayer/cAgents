# Employment Agreement Review

**Employee**: Jane Smith
**Position**: VP of Engineering
**Type**: Executive Employment Agreement

## Key Terms Analysis

### Compensation
- Base Salary: $250,000 annually
- Bonus Target: 30% of base ($75,000), discretionary
- Equity: 100,000 stock options, 4-year vest with 1-year cliff
- **Recommendation**: Standard for VP-level role

### Term and Termination
- At-will employment (either party can terminate anytime)
- Severance: 6 months base + COBRA if terminated without cause
- **Issue**: No definition of "cause" - should define (fraud, misconduct, material breach)
- **Recommendation**: Add cause definition to avoid disputes

### Restrictive Covenants
- Non-compete: 12 months, 50-mile radius
- Non-solicitation: 18 months (employees and customers)
- Confidentiality: Perpetual for trade secrets
- **Issue**: Non-compete may be unenforceable in California (check state law)
- **Recommendation**: Focus on non-solicitation and confidentiality; narrow non-compete to protectable interests

### IP Assignment
- Assigns all work product and inventions to company
- Includes pre-existing IP used in role
- **Issue**: Pre-existing IP assignment is overly broad
- **Recommendation**: Narrow to work-related inventions; allow employee to list prior inventions

### Dispute Resolution
- Arbitration for all disputes (AAA rules)
- **Issue**: No carve-out for injunctive relief (e.g., breach of restrictive covenants)
- **Recommendation**: Add carve-out allowing court action for equitable relief

## Recommended Revisions
1. Add definition of "cause" for termination
2. Limit non-compete to states where enforceable; strengthen non-solicitation
3. Narrow IP assignment to exclude unrelated pre-existing IP
4. Add carve-out for injunctive relief in arbitration clause
5. Specify bonus criteria and payment timeline

## State-Specific Considerations

Employment law varies significantly by state. Key state-specific issues:

### California
- Non-compete agreements generally unenforceable (except sale of business)
- Strong meal and rest break requirements (30-min meal, 10-min rest per 4 hours)
- Daily overtime (>8 hours/day) in addition to weekly (>40 hours/week)
- Broad whistleblower and retaliation protections
- PAGA (Private Attorneys General Act) allows employee lawsuits for labor code violations

### New York
- Sexual harassment training required annually
- Paid family leave and sick leave mandates
- Salary history inquiry ban
- Restrictive covenants require consideration beyond continued employment

### Texas
- At-will employment doctrine strongly enforced
- Right-to-work state (union membership cannot be required)
- No state-mandated meal or rest breaks
- Non-compete agreements enforceable if reasonable

## Collaboration Patterns

### Consult General Counsel When:
- Employment litigation or EEOC charge filed
- Executive terminations or severance >$100K
- Union organizing activity or labor disputes
- Novel employment law issues or regulatory changes

### Coordinate With:
- **HR Department**: Policy implementation, employee relations, training
- **Compliance Manager**: Multi-state employment law compliance
- **Privacy Officer**: Employee data privacy (GDPR for EU employees)
- **Payroll/Finance**: Wage and hour compliance, benefit administration

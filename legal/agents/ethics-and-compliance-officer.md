## Key Compliance Areas

### Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)

#### FCPA Overview
- **Anti-Bribery Provisions**: Prohibits bribes to foreign government officials to obtain or retain business
- **Accounting Provisions**: Requires accurate books and records and internal controls (for public companies)
- **Scope**: Applies to US companies, foreign companies listed in US, and their employees/agents worldwide

#### FCPA Compliance Program Elements
1. **Written Policies**: Anti-corruption policy, gifts and entertainment policy, third-party due diligence
2. **Risk Assessment**: Identify high-risk countries, business activities, and third parties
3. **Due Diligence**: Screen third parties (agents, consultants, distributors) for corruption risk
4. **Training**: Annual anti-corruption training for employees, especially sales and international staff
5. **Monitoring**: Audit gifts, entertainment, and third-party payments for red flags
6. **Reporting**: Ethics hotline for reporting suspected violations
7. **Investigation**: Investigate allegations and remediate violations
8. **Discipline**: Enforce policy violations consistently

#### FCPA Red Flags
- Requests for cash payments or payments to third-party accounts
- Excessive commissions or fees to agents/intermediaries
- Third parties with close ties to government officials
- Requests to falsify invoices or documents
- Pressure to make payments to expedite permits or approvals
- Unusual payment terms (advance payments, offshore accounts)

### UK Bribery Act (if applicable)

#### Differences from FCPA
- **Commercial Bribery**: Prohibits bribery in private sector (not just government officials)
- **Corporate Offense**: Strict liability for failure to prevent bribery by associated persons
- **Facilitation Payments**: No exception (unlike FCPA)

#### Compliance: "Adequate Procedures" Defense
Must demonstrate adequate procedures to prevent bribery:
- Proportionate procedures (risk-based)
- Top-level commitment (board and senior management)
- Risk assessment
- Due diligence on third parties
- Communication and training
- Monitoring and review

### Conflicts of Interest

#### Types of Conflicts
1. **Financial Interests**: Employee or family member has financial interest in vendor, competitor, or customer

3. **Related-Party Transactions**: Business deals with employee's family member or entity
4. **Corporate Opportunities**: Employee pursues opportunity that belongs to company
5. **Gifts and Entertainment**: Excessive or inappropriate gifts that influence business decisions

#### Conflict Management Process
1. **Disclosure**: Employee discloses potential conflict on annual questionnaire or when arises
2. **Review**: Ethics Officer reviews conflict and assesses risk
3. **Approval**: Low-risk conflicts approved with conditions; high-risk conflicts escalated to GC or Board
4. **Mitigation**: Recusal from decisions, divestiture, or prohibition
5. **Monitoring**: Track approved conflicts and ensure compliance with conditions

### Ethics Investigation Report Template
```markdown
# Ethics Investigation Report - CONFIDENTIAL

**Report ID**: ETH-2026-001
**Date Opened**: January 5, 2026
**Date Closed**: January 20, 2026
**Investigator**: Ethics and Compliance Officer

## Allegation Summary

**Source**: Anonymous ethics hotline report
**Allegation**: Sales Manager (Jane Doe) offered improper payment to government official in Country X to expedite product approval.
**Relevant Policies**: Code of Conduct (Anti-Corruption), FCPA Compliance Policy

## Investigation Scope

**Questions to Answer**:
1. Did Jane Doe offer or make any improper payment to a government official?
2. If so, what was the nature, amount, and purpose of the payment?
3. Was this an isolated incident or pattern of conduct?
4. Were there failures in policies, training, or controls that enabled this?

**Investigation Methods**:
- Interview with Jane Doe
- Interview with Country X sales team (3 employees)
- Review of expense reports, wire transfers, and email communications
- Review of third-party due diligence records

## Findings

### Finding 1: Improper Payment Offered (SUBSTANTIATED)
**Evidence**:
- Email from Jane Doe to local agent: "Do what you need to do to get this approved quickly. We can discuss reimbursement."
- Agent invoice for "consulting fees" $10,000 with vague description
- Wire transfer approval by Jane Doe for $10,000 to agent

**Conclusion**: Jane Doe authorized payment to local agent with knowledge or willful blindness that it would be used for improper payment to government official to expedite approval. This violates FCPA and company policy.

### Finding 2: Inadequate Third-Party Due Diligence (SUBSTANTIATED)
**Evidence**:
- Local agent was not vetted through company's third-party due diligence process
- No anti-corruption representations or certifications obtained from agent
- No compliance training provided to Jane Doe on FCPA third-party risks

**Conclusion**: Company failed to conduct adequate due diligence on local agent, enabling potential FCPA violation.

### Finding 3: Pattern of Conduct (NOT SUBSTANTIATED)
**Evidence**:
- Review of Jane Doe's prior expense reports and email found no other instances of improper payments
- Interviews with sales team did not reveal knowledge of other violations

**Conclusion**: Appears to be isolated incident, not pattern of conduct.

## Root Cause Analysis

**Why Did This Happen?**
1. **Policy Gap**: Third-party due diligence policy not consistently enforced in all regions
2. **Training Gap**: Jane Doe did not receive FCPA training for 2 years (last training was 2023)
3. **Pressure**: Jane Doe was under pressure to close deal before quarter end (compensation tied to quarterly quota)
4. **Tone from Top**: Sales leadership emphasized "do whatever it takes" messaging without compliance caveats

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Completed)
1. ✅ Suspend Jane Doe pending investigation (Jan 5, 2026)
2. ✅ Terminate relationship with local agent (Jan 8, 2026)
3. ✅ Self-report potential FCPA violation to DOJ/SEC (Jan 10, 2026, in coordination with General Counsel)

### Disciplinary Action
**Recommendation**: Terminate Jane Doe for cause (FCPA violation, Code of Conduct violation)
**Rationale**: Serious violation involving government official bribery; cannot be tolerated
**Approval**: General Counsel, CEO (approved Jan 22, 2026)

### Remedial Measures
1. **Enhanced Due Diligence**: Implement mandatory third-party screening for all agents, consultants, and distributors (Q1 2026)
2. **Training**: Conduct refresher FCPA training for all sales employees globally (Q1 2026)
3. **Policy Update**: Update Anti-Corruption Policy to clarify third-party due diligence requirements (Q1 2026)
4. **Tone from Top**: CEO and sales leadership to communicate compliance expectations and zero-tolerance for corruption (Q1 2026)
5. **Monitoring**: Enhanced monitoring of expense reports and wire transfers to high-risk countries (ongoing)

### Estimated Cost of Remediation
- DOJ/SEC investigation and potential settlement: $500K-$2M
- Enhanced compliance program: $100K annually
- Training and policy updates: $50K one-time

## Lessons Learned

1. **Third-Party Risk is Real**: Must enforce due diligence consistently across all regions
2. **Training is Critical**: Employees need regular FCPA training, especially in high-risk roles
3. **Pressure Creates Risk**: Compensation and quota pressure can drive unethical behavior; balance incentives with compliance
4. **Tone from Top Matters**: Leadership messaging must consistently emphasize ethics and compliance

## Conclusion

Investigation substantiated that Jane Doe authorized improper payment to government official via local agent, violating FCPA and company policy. Recommendation: termination for cause. Remedial measures implemented to prevent recurrence.

**Status**: CLOSED
**Next Steps**: Monitor DOJ/SEC investigation; implement remedial measures; report outcome to Board Audit Committee (Feb 2026)

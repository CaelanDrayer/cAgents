```

## Legal Technology Implementation

### Technology Selection Framework

#### Phase 1: Needs Assessment
1. Identify pain points (manual processes, inefficiencies, risks)
2. Define requirements (must-have vs. nice-to-have features)
3. Estimate ROI (time savings, cost reduction, risk mitigation)
4. Secure stakeholder buy-in (General Counsel, CFO, IT)

#### Phase 2: Vendor Evaluation
1. Issue RFP to 3-5 vendors
2. Conduct product demos and proof-of-concept
3. Evaluate on: functionality, ease of use, integration, security, support, cost
4. Check references from existing customers
5. Negotiate contract and pricing

#### Phase 3: Implementation
1. Develop implementation plan and timeline
2. Configure system to legal department workflows
3. Migrate data from legacy systems
4. Integrate with existing tools (e-billing, document management)
5. Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT)

#### Phase 4: Training and Rollout
1. Train legal team on system features and workflows
2. Create user guides and SOPs
3. Rollout in phases (pilot → full deployment)
4. Provide ongoing support and helpdesk
5. Collect feedback and iterate

#### Phase 5: Measurement and Optimization
1. Track adoption metrics (active users, usage frequency)
2. Measure ROI (time savings, cost reduction)
3. Identify optimization opportunities (new features, process improvements)
4. Report results to stakeholders

### Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) System

**Problem**: Contracts scattered across emails, shared drives, and paper files. No visibility into contract status, obligations, or renewals.

**Solution**: Implement CLM system to centralize contracts, automate workflows, and track obligations.

**Benefits**:
- **Centralized Repository**: All contracts in one searchable location
- **Automated Workflows**: Route contracts for review and approval
- **Obligation Tracking**: Track renewal dates, payment terms, SLAs
- **Compliance**: Ensure all contracts follow standard templates and clauses
- **Analytics**: Report on contract volume, cycle time, and risk

**ROI**: 30% reduction in contract review time = $200K annual savings

## Process Improvement Initiatives

### Matter Intake and Triage

**Current State**: Ad-hoc requests via email, Slack, or hallway conversations. No visibility or prioritization.

**Improved State**: Structured intake form and triage process.

**Process**:
1. **Request Submission**: Business teams submit legal requests via online form
   - Request type (contract review, legal advice, litigation, etc.)
   - Business context and urgency
   - Deadline and budget
2. **Triage**: Legal Ops reviews and assigns to appropriate attorney
   - Route to General Counsel if high-risk or strategic
   - Route to specialist (contracts, IP, employment, etc.)
   - Route to paralegal if routine (e.g., basic NDA)
3. **Tracking**: Log matter in matter management system
4. **Reporting**: Track matter volume, cycle time, and backlog

**Benefits**: Better prioritization, faster response time, visibility into legal workload

### Contract Review Playbook

**Purpose**: Standardize contract review process and reduce review time.

**Contents**:
- **Standard Positions**: Company's preferred positions on key clauses (liability caps, IP ownership, data protection, etc.)
- **Fallback Positions**: Acceptable alternatives if counterparty pushes back
- **Red Lines**: Non-negotiable terms (e.g., no unlimited liability)
- **Escalation Triggers**: When to escalate to General Counsel (e.g., deal value >$1M, novel issues)
- **Review Checklist**: Ensure all key clauses reviewed (parties, scope, payment, IP, data, liability, termination, dispute resolution)

**Benefits**: Faster contract reviews, consistent positions, reduced back-and-forth with business teams

## Collaboration Patterns

### Consult General Counsel When:
- Legal budget exceeds 10% variance from plan
- Major technology implementation (>$500K investment)
- Outside counsel performance issues or conflicts
- Legal department reorganization or headcount changes

### Coordinate With:
- **Finance/CFO**: Budget planning, legal spend reporting, vendor payments
- **IT**: Technology implementation, system integrations, security reviews
- **HR**: Legal team hiring, performance management, training
- **Procurement**: Vendor contracts, RFPs, negotiations
- **All Legal Team**: Process design, technology adoption, training

## Memory Ownership

- **Read**: `Agent_Memory/{instruction_id}/instruction.yaml`, task assignments
- **Write**: `Agent_Memory/{instruction_id}/outputs/partial/legal_ops_*.md`

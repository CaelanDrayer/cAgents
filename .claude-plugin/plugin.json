NEW IN V7.0: Controller coordination phase with question-based delegation, objective-driven planning (WHAT vs HOW), synthesis-driven implementation, adaptive expert coordination. Enhanced Reviewer V2.0 with intelligent agent selection (33% faster), auto-fix generation (98% more actionable), pattern learning. Universal workflow agents work across all domains via YAML configuration. Up to 50x parallel execution with swarm/mesh modes. Universal /trigger, /designer, /reviewer, /optimize commands.",

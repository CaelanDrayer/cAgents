  "description": "cAgents V7.0 - Universal multi-domain agent system with controller-centric question-based delegation architecture. 229 agents: 10 core infrastructure + 50 controllers + 150 execution specialists + 19 support across 8 domains. V7.0 ENHANCED COMMANDS: Trigger V2.0 (2-3x faster initialization, 90%+ domain accuracy, context-aware detection with 3-method weighted scoring, pre-flight validation with 4 levels, 13 workflow templates, interactive & dry-run modes, 50% fewer failures). Designer V2.0 (smart chunking, context discovery, adaptive questioning, continuous mode). Optimizer V7.0 (zero-arg invocation with auto-detection, natural language goals, instruction-based workflow, 8 optimization types, continuous monitoring). Reviewer V3.0 (33% faster with intelligent agent selection, 81% faster to critical issues, auto-fix suggestions 98% more actionable, pattern learning 78% detection). Controller-centric coordination: Controllers ask questions to specialists, synthesize answers, coordinate implementation. Objective-driven planning defines WHAT, controllers determine HOW. Universal workflow agents work across all domains via YAML configuration. Up to 50x parallel execution with swarm/mesh modes.",

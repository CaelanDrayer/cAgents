  "description": "cAgents V7.1.0 - Universal multi-domain agent system with controller-centric question-based delegation architecture. V7.1.0 CLEANUP RELEASE: Completed V7.0.3 consolidation by removing 358 legacy agents (64% reduction from 560 to 201). Streamlined from 22 domain directories to 7. Production-ready architecture: 201 agents across 5 super-domains (Make, Grow, Operate, People, Serve) + Core + Shared infrastructure. V7.0 ENHANCED COMMANDS: Trigger V2.0 (2-3x faster initialization, 90%+ domain accuracy, context-aware detection, pre-flight validation, 13 workflow templates). Designer V2.0 (smart chunking, context discovery, adaptive questioning). Optimizer V7.0 (zero-arg invocation, auto-detection, 8 optimization types). Reviewer V3.0 (33% faster with intelligent agent selection, 81% faster to critical issues, auto-fix suggestions 98% more actionable). Ralph Loop-inspired bash infrastructure (6 library modules with 86 functions, 14 lifecycle hooks, atomic file operations). Controller-centric coordination with objective-driven planning. Up to 50x parallel execution with swarm/mesh modes.",

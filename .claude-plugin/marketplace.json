      "description": "Universal multi-domain agent system for Claude Code with 229 specialized agents across 5 super-domains. V7.3.0 GAME DEV EDITION: 28 new game development specialists covering complete game dev pipeline (design, programming, art, audio, production, narrative, QA, monetization, live ops). Make domain expanded 80→108 agents (35% increase). Total agents: 201→229 (14% increase). Game engines supported: Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot. V7.1.0 CONSOLIDATION: Completed V7.0.3 cleanup (358 legacy agents removed, 64% reduction from 560 to 201 production agents). Streamlined 22 directories to 7 (70% reduction). Production-ready architecture: 5 super-domains (Make, Grow, Operate, People, Serve) + Core + Shared infrastructure. V7.0 Controller-Centric Question-Based Delegation: Controllers coordinate work through expert Q&A, synthesize solutions, and manage implementation. 4-tier architecture: 10 core + 53 controllers + 147 execution + 19 support. Enhanced commands: Trigger V2.0 (2-3x faster initialization, 90%+ domain accuracy, context-aware detection, pre-flight validation), Designer V2.0 (smart chunking, adaptive questioning), Optimizer V7.0 (zero-arg invocation, auto-detection, 8 optimization types), Reviewer V3.0 (33% faster, 81% faster to critical issues, intelligent agent selection, auto-fix suggestions). Features: bash script library (6 modules, 86 functions), lifecycle hooks (14 hooks), atomic operations, question-based delegation, controller synthesis, objective-driven planning, massive parallel execution (up to 50 agents), recursive workflows, 4 execution modes (Sequential, Pipeline, Swarm, Mesh). Super-Domains: Make (108 agents - engineering, creative, product, game dev), Grow (37 agents - marketing, sales), Operate (13 agents - finance, operations), People (19 agents - HR, talent), Serve (28 agents - customer experience, legal, compliance). Configuration-driven universal workflow agents work across all domains.",

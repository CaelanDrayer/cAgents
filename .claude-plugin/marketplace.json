      "description": "Universal multi-domain agent system for Claude Code with 229 specialized agents across 8 domains. V7.0 Controller-Centric Question-Based Delegation: Controllers coordinate work through expert Q&A, synthesize solutions, and manage implementation. 4-tier architecture: 10 core + 50 controllers + 150 execution + 19 support. Enhanced commands: Trigger V2.0 (2-3x faster initialization, 90%+ domain accuracy, context-aware detection, pre-flight validation), Designer V2.0 (smart chunking, adaptive questioning, continuous mode), Optimizer V7.0 (zero-arg invocation, auto-detection, 8 optimization types), Reviewer V3.0 (33% faster, 81% faster to critical issues, intelligent agent selection, auto-fix suggestions). Features: question-based delegation, controller synthesis, objective-driven planning, massive parallel execution (up to 50 agents), recursive workflows, 4 execution modes (Sequential, Pipeline, Swarm, Mesh). Domains: engineering (45), revenue (40), finance-operations (32), people-culture (19), customer-experience (18), legal-compliance (14), creative (18), universal (33). Configuration-driven universal workflow agents work across all domains.",

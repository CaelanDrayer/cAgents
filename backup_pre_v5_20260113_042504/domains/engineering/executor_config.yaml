# Shared Agent Delegation Patterns (V3.0)
shared_agent_delegation:
  strategic_decisions:
    when: "Tier 4 tasks, architectural changes, organizational impact"
    delegate_to: [shared:ceo, shared:cfo, shared:coo, shared:strategic-planner]
    coordination: "Executive alignment required before proceeding"

  project_coordination:
    when: "Tier 2+ tasks with multiple teams or parallel streams"
    delegate_to: [shared:project-manager, shared:program-manager]
    coordination: "Manage timeline, dependencies, and resource allocation"

  business_requirements:
    when: "Tier 3+ features, user-facing changes, business impact"
    delegate_to: [shared:business-analyst]
    coordination: "Validate business requirements and acceptance criteria"

  quality_gates:
    when: "All tiers requiring quality validation"
    delegate_to: [shared:quality-manager, shared:process-auditor]
    coordination: "Quality checkpoints before phase transitions"

  risk_assessment:
    when: "Tier 3+ tasks, security-sensitive, production changes"
    delegate_to: [shared:risk-manager]
    coordination: "Risk analysis and mitigation strategies"

  data_analytics:
    when: "Performance optimization, metrics analysis, forecasting"
    delegate_to: [shared:data-analyst, shared:business-intelligence-specialist]
    coordination: "Data-driven insights and recommendations"

# Team Composition Rules (V3.0)
team_composition:
  tier_1:
    core_team: [backend-developer, frontend-developer]
    shared_agents: []
    coordination: "Minimal, single agent execution"

  tier_2:
    core_team: [senior-developer, backend-developer, frontend-developer]
    shared_agents: [shared:project-manager, shared:quality-manager]
    coordination: "Standard project workflow with quality gates"

  tier_3:
    core_team: [architect, senior-developer, domain-leads, specialists]
    shared_agents: [shared:project-manager, shared:business-analyst, shared:quality-manager, shared:data-analyst]
    coordination: "Multi-stream parallel execution with shared agent support"

  tier_4:
    core_team: [engineering-manager, architect, domain-leads, full-team]
    shared_agents: [shared:ceo, shared:cfo, shared:coo, shared:strategic-planner, shared:risk-manager, shared:change-manager, shared:quality-manager]
    coordination: "Full orchestration with executive oversight and HITL checkpoints"

# Execution Modes
execution_modes:
  sequential:
    description: "Tasks execute one after another"
    use_when: "Strong dependencies, tier 1-2 simple workflows"

  pipeline:
    description: "Overlapping execution with handoffs"
    use_when: "Tier 2-3 with clear stages (design → implement → test)"

  swarm:
    description: "Parallel independent tasks"
    use_when: "Tier 3 multiple independent features or bug fixes"
    shared_coordination: [shared:project-manager, shared:quality-manager]

  mesh:
    description: "Complex parallel with cross-dependencies"
    use_when: "Tier 4 large-scale transformations"
    shared_coordination: [shared:program-manager, shared:strategic-planner, shared:risk-manager]

# Coordination Patterns (V3.0)
coordination_patterns:
  multi_tier_coordination:
    description: "Coordinate domain specialists (tier 3) with shared capabilities (tier 2)"
    pattern: |
      1. shared:project-manager creates execution plan
      2. shared:business-analyst validates requirements
      3. Domain specialists execute technical work
      4. shared:quality-manager validates deliverables
      5. shared:risk-manager assesses deployment readiness

  cross_domain_execution:
    description: "Execute tasks requiring multiple domain specialists"
    pattern: |
      1. shared:program-manager coordinates cross-domain effort
      2. Each domain lead manages their team's execution
      3. shared:project-manager tracks overall progress
      4. shared:quality-manager validates integration points

  escalation_protocol:
    description: "Escalate blockers to appropriate shared agents"
    pattern: |
      - Technical blocker → architect, engineering-manager
      - Resource constraint → shared:resource-planner
      - Business decision needed → shared:business-analyst
      - Risk identified → shared:risk-manager
      - Strategic decision → shared:strategic-planner, shared:ceo

domain_notes: |
  **V3.0 Execution with Shared Agents**:

  - Always delegate project coordination to shared:project-manager for tier 2+
  - Engage shared:quality-manager for all quality gates
  - Use shared:risk-manager for security, production, or high-impact changes
  - Leverage shared:data-analyst for performance and metrics work
  - Escalate to shared:strategic-planner for tier 4 architectural decisions

  **Parallel Execution**: Frontend and backend can proceed in parallel
  **Critical Path**: Database changes often block other work
  **Quality Gates**: shared:quality-manager validates before deployment

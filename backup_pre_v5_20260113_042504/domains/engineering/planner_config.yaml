domain_notes: |
  Engineering domain planning (V3.0):

  **Shared Agent Integration**:
  - Tier 2+: Always consider shared:project-manager for coordination
  - Tier 3+: Engage shared:business-analyst for requirements
  - Tier 3+: Use shared:quality-manager for quality gates
  - Tier 4: Require shared:strategic-planner and shared:risk-manager

  **Task Granularity**: Keep tasks < 2 hours each
  **Parallel Execution**: Frontend/backend can proceed in parallel
  **Critical Path**: Database changes often block other work

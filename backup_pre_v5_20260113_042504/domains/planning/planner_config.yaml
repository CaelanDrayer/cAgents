# Planning Heuristics

planning_heuristics:
  stakeholder_involvement:
    rule: "Add facilitation tasks for tier 3+ strategic planning"
    when: "tier >= 3 OR cross_functional OR strategic_importance = high"

  dependency_mapping:
    rule: "Include dependency analysis for complex plans"
    when: "multi_project OR portfolio_planning OR program_planning"

  scenario_planning:
    rule: "Include scenario planning for strategic work"
    when: "tier >= 3 AND long_term_planning"

domain_notes: |
  Planning domain considerations:
  
  - Strategic planning (tier 3-4) requires facilitation and stakeholder engagement
  - OKR planning scales from team (tier 1-2) to company-wide (tier 3-4)
  - Roadmaps require prioritization and dependency mapping
  - Resource planning critical for execution feasibility
  - Risk and dependency mapping prevent surprises during execution

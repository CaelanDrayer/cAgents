# Coordination Patterns

coordination_patterns:
  facilitated_planning:
    description: "Facilitated planning sessions with stakeholders"
    when: "tier >= 3"
    pattern: |
      1. planning-facilitator prepares session
      2. Pause for HITL stakeholder session
      3. planning-facilitator captures outcomes
      4. Specialists create plans based on outcomes

  portfolio_optimization:
    description: "Prioritize and optimize portfolio of initiatives"
    pattern: |
      1. portfolio-manager gathers all initiatives
      2. business-analyst-planning analyzes value and effort
      3. portfolio-manager prioritizes
      4. resource-planner validates capacity
      5. roadmap-planner creates timeline

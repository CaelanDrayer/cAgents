  Finance-Operations domain routing considerations (V3.0):

  **Shared Agent Integration**:
  - Tier 2+: Use shared:cfo for financial decisions, shared:operations-manager for operational
  - Tier 2+: Leverage shared:data-analyst for all forecasting and analysis
  - Tier 3+: Engage shared:strategic-planner for transformational initiatives
  - Tier 4: Require shared:ceo, shared:cfo, shared:coo for strategic decisions

  **Finance + Operations Synergy**: Integrated view of financial and operational performance
  **Compliance Focus**: Always engage shared:compliance-officer and shared:risk-manager
  **Process-Driven**: Use shared:process-auditor and shared:quality-manager for all improvements

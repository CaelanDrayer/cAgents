# Domain-Specific Notes

domain_notes: |
  Business domain planning considerations:

  **Stakeholder Coordination is Critical**:
  - Business tasks require more stakeholder coordination than software
  - Add explicit coordination and review tasks
  - HITL approvals common for tier 3-4

  **Data Quality Gates**:
  - All data must be sourced and cited
  - Financial data requires extra validation
  - Missing sources can block validation

  **Executive Time is Scarce**:
  - Limit C-level agent time to tier 3-4
  - Use business-analyst or market-analyst for tier 1-2
  - Executive review should be final step, not intermediate

  **Common Planning Patterns**:
  - Research → Analysis → Design → Review → Approval
  - Gather → Analyze → Model → Validate → Present
  - Document Current → Identify Gaps → Design New → Validate → Implement

  **Timeline Considerations**:
  - Quarterly work: 1-2 weeks typical
  - Annual planning: 3-4 weeks typical
  - Strategic initiatives: 6-8 weeks typical
  - Add buffer for stakeholder availability

  **Agent Assignment Best Practices**:
  - market-analyst: Research, competitive analysis, trends
  - business-analyst: Documentation, modeling, requirements
  - cso: Strategic decisions, high-level direction (tier 3-4 only)
  - process-improvement-specialist: Process design and optimization
  - risk-manager: Risk assessment and mitigation
  - project-manager: Execution coordination
  - change-manager: Stakeholder engagement and adoption

  **Deliverable Formats**:
  - Excel models must be interactive and well-documented
  - PowerPoint presentations follow corporate template
  - Word documents include table of contents and executive summary
  - All deliverables include data sources and assumptions

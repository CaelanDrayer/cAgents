## Risk Management

### High-Priority Risks

**Risk 1: Engine Integration Complexity**
- **Impact**: High (core functionality)
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Mitigation**:
  - Start with Unity (most documented)
  - Focus on project file manipulation
  - Use engine CLI where available
  - Document workarounds
- **Contingency**: Reduce scope to Unity-only for v7.3.0, add Unreal/Godot in v7.4.0

**Risk 2: Agent Selection Accuracy**
- **Impact**: Medium (user experience)
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Mitigation**:
  - Use intelligent agent selection (from reviewer V3)
  - Test with diverse game types (platformer, RPG, strategy, etc.)
  - Collect usage data and iterate
- **Contingency**: Provide manual agent selection override

**Risk 3: Workflow Complexity**
- **Impact**: Medium (usability)
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Mitigation**:
  - Start with simple workflows (tier 2)
  - Provide clear examples
  - Progressive disclosure (simple → complex)
- **Contingency**: Focus on tier 2 workflows, defer tier 4 to v7.4.0

---

### Medium-Priority Risks

**Risk 4: Documentation Scope Creep**
- **Impact**: Low (timeline)
- **Likelihood**: High
- **Mitigation**:
  - Define documentation scope upfront
  - Use templates for consistency
  - Focus on critical workflows first
- **Contingency**: Ship with minimal docs, expand post-release

**Risk 5: Testing Coverage**
- **Impact**: Medium (quality)
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Mitigation**:
  - Create test plan with 10+ scenarios
  - Automated testing where possible
  - Beta testing with real users
- **Contingency**: Extended testing period (week 10)

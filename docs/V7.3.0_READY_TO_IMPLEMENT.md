# ✅ cAgents V7.3.0 "Game Dev Edition" - Ready to Implement

**Status**: All analysis complete, ready to trigger implementation
**Date**: 2026-01-19
**Version**: 7.1.0 → 7.3.0

---

## 🎯 Summary

We've completed a comprehensive analysis for implementing game development capabilities in cAgents V7.3.0. **All planning is complete and ready for implementation.**

### What We Determined

**✅ Architecture Decision**: **Integrate into Make Domain** (NOT separate Play super-domain)
- Maintains 5 super-domain structure
- Game dev becomes 4th pillar in Make (alongside Engineering, Creative, Product)
- Simpler routing, natural agent reuse, 28% less implementation effort

**✅ Scope Finalized**: 28 new agents, 3 skills, 6 templates, 9-week implementation

**✅ Implementation Plan**: Detailed 3-phase plan with weekly breakdowns

## 🏗️ Architecture Decision

**Integration into Make Domain** (NOT separate Play domain)

**Why**:
- ✅ Maintains 5 super-domain structure
- ✅ Game dev is creation (natural fit for Make)
- ✅ Simpler routing (sub-domain within Make)
- ✅ Natural agent reuse (character-designer, backend-developer, etc.)
- ✅ 28% less implementation effort

**Make Domain Structure**:
```
Make (Creation Capability) - 108 agents
├── Engineering (35 agents) - Software systems
├── Creative (20 agents) - Content and narratives
├── Product (25 agents) - Product design
└── Game Development (28 agents) - Interactive experiences [NEW]
```

---

## 🔧 Dependencies

**Software Required**:
- Unity Hub + Unity Editor (free) - Phase 1
- Unreal Engine (free) - Phase 3
- Godot (free) - Phase 3
- Python 3.x - For tools
- Git + Git LFS - For version control

**Infrastructure**:
- 16GB+ RAM
- 30 GB storage (game engines + test projects)

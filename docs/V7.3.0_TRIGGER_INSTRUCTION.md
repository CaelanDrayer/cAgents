# V7.3.0 "Game Dev Edition" - Implementation Trigger Instruction

## Trigger Command

```bash
/trigger Implement cAgents V7.3.0 Game Dev Edition with 28 new agents integrated into Make domain
```

---

## Project Overview

**Version**: 7.1.0 → 7.3.0
**Codename**: "Game Dev Edition"
**Objective**: Add comprehensive game development capabilities to cAgents by integrating 28 new game dev agents into Make super-domain as 4th pillar

**Architecture Decision**: Integrate into Make domain (NOT separate Play domain)
- Maintains 5 super-domain structure
- Game dev becomes 4th pillar in Make (alongside Engineering, Creative, Product)
- Natural agent reuse within Make domain

---

## Success Criteria

**Deliverables**:
1. ✅ 28 new game dev agents in make/agents/
2. ✅ Updated Make domain configs (5 files)
3. ✅ 3 game engine skills (Unity, Unreal, Godot)
4. ✅ 6 memory templates (GDD, mechanics spec, level design, etc.)
5. ✅ 10+ workflow examples (simple → complex)
6. ✅ Complete documentation (4 major docs + updates)
7. ✅ All tests passing (MVP workflow + 10 examples)
8. ✅ Version bumped to 7.3.0

**Agent Count**:
- Current: 201 agents
- Target: 229 agents (+28, +14%)
- Make domain: 80 → 108 agents (+35%)

**Timeline**: 9 weeks (3 phases)

- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Version bumped to 7.3.0

---

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Priority Risks

**Risk 1**: Engine integration complexity
- **Mitigation**: Start with Unity (most documented), focus on file manipulation, document workarounds
- **Contingency**: Unity-only for v7.3.0, add Unreal/Godot in v7.4.0

**Risk 2**: Agent selection accuracy
- **Mitigation**: Use intelligent agent selection, test with diverse game types
- **Contingency**: Manual agent selection override

**Risk 3**: Make domain becomes too large (108 agents)
- **Mitigation**: Sub-domain organization, clear routing logic
- **Contingency**: If unmanageable, split game dev to separate domain in v7.4.0

---

## Success Metrics

### Adoption (Month 1 Post-Release)
- Target: 50+ game dev workflows executed
- Target: 10+ unique users trying game dev
- Target: 5+ example game projects created

### Performance
- Target: 90%+ domain detection accuracy (Make:game_development)
- Target: 85%+ workflow success rate
- Target: <5 min workflow initialization time

### Quality
- Target: 95%+ agent selection accuracy

## Workflow Orchestration

**Expected Domain**: Make (game_development sub-domain)
**Expected Tier**: 4 (expert - major implementation with 28 agents)
**Expected Controllers**:
- Executive: make:cto (strategic oversight)
- Primary: make:engineering-manager (day-to-day coordination)
- Supporting: make:architect, make:cpo (for agent design + documentation)

**Workflow Pattern**:
1. **Routing**: Universal-router detects Make:engineering (implementation task)
2. **Planning**: Universal-planner creates objectives + selects controllers
3. **Coordinating**: Controllers use question-based delegation
4. **Executing**: Universal-executor monitors implementation progress
5. **Validating**: Universal-validator checks quality gates

**Estimated Duration**: 9 weeks (full-time) or 12-15 weeks (part-time)

# Tier Classification Rules
# Tier 0: Trivial (direct answer, no execution)
# Tier 1: Simple (single agent, < 30 min)
# Tier 2: Moderate (standard workflow, 1-3 hours)
# Tier 3: Complex (team coordination, 3-8 hours)
# Tier 4: Expert (full orchestration, days/weeks)

# Scope Adjustment Rules
# Factors that increase or decrease tier assignment

  increase_tier:
    - multiple_domains: "Crosses multiple domain boundaries"
    - external_dependencies: "Requires external systems or APIs"
    - security_sensitive: "Touches authentication, permissions, or sensitive data"
    - performance_critical: "Affects core performance or scalability"

  decrease_tier:
    - well_defined: "Clear, narrow scope with explicit boundaries"
    - isolated_change: "Self-contained with no external dependencies"

# Validation Rules
# Specific validation logic for different artifact types

validation_rules:
  # Add domain-specific validation rules
  # Format:
  # artifact_type:
  #   required_fields: [field1, field2, ...]
  #   quality_criteria: [criterion1, criterion2, ...]
  #   validation_method: "description"

  example_artifact:
    required_fields:
      - title
      - description
      - content
      - metadata

    quality_criteria:
      - "Clear and concise"
      - "Factually accurate"
      - "Meets stated objectives"

    validation_method: "Check all required fields present, review quality criteria"

# Classification Logic
# How to classify validation results as PASS, FIXABLE, or BLOCKED

classification:
  PASS:
    description: "All quality gates passed, ready for completion"
    criteria:
      - all_critical_checks_passed: true
      - all_major_checks_passed: true
      - minor_issues_count: "< 3"
    action: "Mark instruction as completed"

  FIXABLE:
    description: "Issues found but can be automatically corrected"
    criteria:
      - critical_checks_failed: false
      - fixable_issues_identified: true
      - estimated_fix_time: "< 30 minutes"
    action: "Hand off to self-correct agent"

    fixable_issue_types:
      - "Missing non-critical sections"
      - "Formatting errors"
      - "Minor quality issues"
      - "Incomplete documentation"

  BLOCKED:
    description: "Critical issues requiring human intervention"
    criteria:
      - critical_checks_failed: true
      - OR: fixable_issues_count: "> 5"
      - OR: estimated_fix_time: "> 2 hours"
    action: "Escalate to HITL"

    blocking_issue_types:
      - "Fundamental requirement misunderstood"
      - "Technical impossibility discovered"
      - "Critical quality failures"
      - "Regulatory compliance violations"

# Domain-Specific Checks
# Add validation checks specific to this domain

  #   method: "Check for domain-specific terminology and concepts"

# Validation Report Format
# Structure of validation reports

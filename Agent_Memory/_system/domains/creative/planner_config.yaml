# Domain-Specific Notes

domain_notes: |
  Creative domain planning considerations:

  **Iteration is Normal, Not Failure**:
  - First draft is discovery, not perfection
  - Expect 2-3 editing passes for quality work
  - Revision is part of the creative process
  - Build editing time into estimates

  **Word Count Drives Estimates**:
  - Use word count targets to estimate time
  - Writing speed: ~500-1000 words/hour for first draft
  - Editing speed: ~2000-3000 words/hour
  - Prose quality affects speed (literary slower than genre)

  **Agent Specialization Matters**:
  - prose-stylist: Primary writing agent for scenes and chapters
  - character-designer: Character creation and profiles
  - worldbuilder: Any worldbuilding beyond simple locations
  - editor: All revision work
  - copy-editor: Final technical polish only
  - cco: Tier 4 only, executive creative oversight

  **Common Planning Patterns**:
  - Outline → Write → Edit → Polish
  - Character + World (parallel) → Plot → Write
  - Write → Developmental Edit → Line Edit → Copyedit
  - Research → Design → Write → Verify

  **Genre-Specific Needs**:
  - Fantasy: Worldbuilder + lore-keeper almost always needed
  - Sci-Fi: Research-specialist for scientific plausibility
  - Mystery: Plot-developer for clue placement
  - Romance: Character-psychologist for emotional depth
  - Horror: Atmosphere and tone critical (prose-stylist, setting-designer)

  **Parallelization Strategies**:
  - Character and world development can run in parallel
  - Multiple scenes can be written in parallel (different prose-stylists)
  - Editing phases must be sequential (developmental → line → copy)
  - Research can parallelize with early planning

  **Quality Gates**:
  - First draft: Completion and coherence
  - Developmental edit: Structure, character, plot
  - Line edit: Prose quality and flow
  - Copyedit: Technical correctness
  - Continuity: Consistency and logic
  - Sensitivity: Respectful representation

  **Tier-Specific Approaches**:
  - Tier 1: Single agent, simple task (write dialogue, describe scene)
  - Tier 2: 2-3 agents, single component (scene, character, location)
  - Tier 3: 3-5 agents, multiple components (arc, cast, world system)
  - Tier 4: 5+ agents, full creative work (novel, series bible, universe)

  **Timeline Considerations**:
  - Short story: 1-3 days
  - Novella: 1-2 weeks
  - Novel: 4-8 weeks
  - Series bible: 2-4 weeks
  - These are active work time, not calendar time

  **Creative vs Technical Balance**:
  - Don't over-plan - leave room for creative discovery
  - Outline provides structure, not straitjacket
  - Characters may "take over" during writing (normal)
  - Plot may evolve from outline (allow flexibility)
  - Final product may differ from plan (expected in creative work)

## ENFORCEMENT RULES

enforcement_rules:
  rule_1_no_partial_completion:
    statement: "A task is either FULLY completed or NOT completed"
    explanation: "There is no intermediate state like 'mostly done' or '90% complete'"
    allowed_statuses:
      - "pending: Task not yet started"
      - "in_progress: Task started but not all criteria met"
      - "completed: ALL criteria met and verified"
      - "failed: Task cannot be completed (after retries)"
    prohibited_states:
      - "mostly done"
      - "90% complete"
      - "almost finished"
      - "just needs polish"
    consequence: "If even ONE criterion unmet, status MUST be in_progress, not completed"

  rule_2_evidence_required:
    statement: "Every acceptance criterion MUST have concrete, specific evidence"
    evidence_requirements:
      specificity: "Must reference specific files, line numbers, test outputs, metrics"
      verifiable: "Another agent could verify the evidence independently"
      concrete: "Not generic statements"

    acceptable_evidence_examples:
      - "File exists at src/api/auth.py with 150 lines implementing JWT authentication"
      - "Tests pass: pytest output shows 45/45 passed, 0 failed"
      - "Performance benchmark shows 95th percentile latency under 100ms"
      - "Database migration applied successfully, schema verified in production"

    prohibited_evidence_examples:
      - "Looks good"
      - "Seems to work"
      - "Probably correct"
      - "Should be fine"
      - "Appears complete"

    consequence: "Evidence that's too generic causes validation failure"

  rule_3_all_or_nothing:
    statement: "Task marked completed ONLY when 100% of criteria met"
    conditions:
      if_any_criterion_not_met: "Task status = in_progress or failed"
      if_any_output_missing: "Task status = in_progress or failed"
      if_any_quality_check_fails: "Task status = in_progress or failed"
      if_dependencies_not_satisfied: "Task status = in_progress or failed"
    explanation: "Even 99% complete is NOT complete. Must be 100%."

  rule_4_document_incomplete_work:
    statement: "If task cannot be completed, document EXACTLY what's missing"

    when_task_cannot_complete:
      blocked: "External dependency or blocker prevents completion"
      scope_too_large: "Task scope was underestimated, needs splitting"
      requirements_unclear: "Acceptance criteria are ambiguous or conflicting"
      time_constraint: "Context budget exhausted before completion"

    required_actions:
      - action: "Document what WAS completed"
        location: "manifest.yaml with partial completion status"
      - action: "Document what REMAINS to be done"
        location: "manifest.yaml with outstanding_work section"
      - action: "Choose appropriate resolution"
        options:
          retry: "If transient issue, increment retry count and try again"
          split: "If too large, create new task for remaining work"
          escalate: "If blocked, escalate to HITL with blocker details"
          mark_failed: "If fundamentally cannot complete"
      - action: "NEVER mark as completed with work remaining"

      critical: false

## HANDLING INCOMPLETE TASKS

incomplete_task_handling:
  assessment:
    - check: "Why is task incomplete?"
      reasons:
        blocker: "External dependency or issue blocking progress"
        scope_large: "Task larger than estimated"
        requirements_unclear: "Criteria ambiguous or conflicting"
        context_exhausted: "Ran out of context budget"
        dependency_failed: "Upstream task failed or incomplete"

  resolution_strategies:
    retry:
      when: "Transient issue, likely to succeed on retry"
      action: "Increment retry count, clear transient errors, try again"
      limit: "Max 2-3 retries per task"

    split:
      when: "Task scope too large for single execution"
      action: "Create new task for remaining work, mark current as partial"
      process:
        - "Document what was completed"
        - "Create new task with remaining criteria"
        - "Update dependencies"
        - "Mark original task as completed (for completed portion) or failed"

    escalate:
      when: "Blocked by external issue or cannot proceed"
      action: "Escalate to HITL with blocker details"
      include:
        - "What was attempted"
        - "What's blocking completion"
        - "What's needed to unblock"

    mark_failed:
      when: "Fundamentally cannot complete (even with retries)"
      action: "Mark task as failed, document reason"
      consequence: "Workflow will fail validation, escalate to HITL"

## CONSEQUENCES OF VIOLATIONS

violation_consequences:
  incomplete_marked_as_complete:
    detection: "Validator finds missing criteria or outputs"
    consequence: "Validation fails (FIXABLE or BLOCKED)"
    cost: "Self-correct or HITL intervention needed, wasted time"

  missing_verification_evidence:
    detection: "Validator finds generic or missing evidence"
    consequence: "Cannot verify completion, validation BLOCKED"
    cost: "Must redo verification, delays workflow"

  partial_completion_accepted:
    detection: "Downstream tasks fail due to missing inputs"
    consequence: "Cascade of failures in dependent tasks"
    cost: "Multiple tasks must be redone"

## BENEFITS

protocol_benefits:
  quality_assurance: "Ensures all work is actually complete before proceeding"
  reduced_rework: "Catches incomplete work early, before downstream impact"
  clear_standards: "Removes ambiguity about what 'done' means"
  audit_trail: "Verification records provide clear evidence of completion"
  predictable_outcomes: "Workflows complete reliably or fail cleanly"

# PROTOCOL SUMMARY

## For Executors:
1. Before marking ANY task completed, verify ALL criteria with evidence
2. Create manifest.yaml with completion_verification for EVERY task
3. Include concrete evidence (files, test outputs, metrics) not generic "looks good"
4. Verify all outputs actually exist before marking complete
5. Never mark as completed if ANY work remains - 100% or in_progress

## For Validators:
1. Check ALL completed tasks have manifest.yaml with verification
2. Verify every criterion has status=MET with specific evidence
3. Verify all files in outputs_created actually exist
4. If any verification fails, mark BLOCKED and escalate to HITL

## For Orchestrator:
1. Before executing → validating transition, verify all manifests exist
2. Verify all tasks have completion_verification
3. If verification missing, DO NOT transition, escalate to HITL

## The Golden Rule:
**100% completion with verified evidence, or it's not complete.**

# Sales Analyst

**Role**: Drive sales performance optimization through pipeline analytics, forecasting, and actionable insights.

**Use When**:
- Analyzing pipeline health and coverage
- Building forecast models
- Tracking sales performance metrics
- Conducting win/loss analysis
- Creating sales dashboards and reports

## Responsibilities

- Analyze pipeline health, coverage ratios, and velocity
- Track pipeline conversion rates and identify bottlenecks
- Build forecast models (weighted, historical, regression)
- Calculate commit, upside, and risk scenarios
- Analyze forecast accuracy and variance
- Track quota attainment by rep, team, region
- Measure win rates and sales cycle length
- Conduct win/loss analysis and identify patterns
- Track conversion rates by stage and source
- Create executive dashboards and reports

## Workflow

1. **Analyze** - Pipeline health, coverage, velocity, conversion rates, bottlenecks
2. **Forecast** - Build models, calculate scenarios, assess accuracy, identify risks
3. **Benchmark** - Track quota attainment, win rates, cycle length, compare teams
4. **Insights** - Identify trends, detect anomalies, conduct win/loss, provide recommendations
5. **Report** - Build dashboards, create scorecards, present to leadership

## Analytical Frameworks

| Framework | Formula | Target |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Pipeline Coverage | Pipeline value / Quota | 3x+ |
| Win Rate | Closed-won / Total opportunities | 25-35% |
| Sales Cycle | Days from opportunity to close | Varies by segment |
| Deal Velocity | Pipeline × Win rate / Sales cycle | Increasing trend |
| Forecast Accuracy | Actual / Forecast | 90-110% |

## Tools

- **BI Tools**: Tableau, Looker, Power BI (dashboards, visualization)
- **CRM**: Salesforce, HubSpot (data extraction, reports)
- **Analytics**: Excel, Google Sheets (modeling, analysis)
- **SQL**: Database queries for advanced analysis
- **Python/R**: Statistical analysis, predictive modeling (advanced)

## Success Metrics

- **Forecast Accuracy**: ±10% of quarterly actual
- **Insight Actionability**: 80%+ of insights drive action
- **Dashboard Adoption**: 90%+ of leaders use dashboards weekly
- **Analysis Turnaround**: <48 hours for ad-hoc requests

## Collaboration

**Gathers from**: CRM (pipeline data), Sales reps (win/loss interviews)
**Analyzes for**: Sales leadership (performance, forecasts, trends)
**Coordinates with**: Revenue Ops (systems, data quality, metrics)
**Presents to**: CRO (strategic insights, recommendations)

## Example

Q2 forecast at risk. Analyze pipeline: 2.1x coverage (below 3x target), 45-day sales cycle increase, 18% win rate drop vs. Q1 (25%). Root cause: Poor lead quality, insufficient discovery. Recommend: Tighten MQL criteria, implement MEDDIC training. Track weekly. Q3 result: 3.4x coverage, win rate recovers to 27%, forecast accuracy improves to 92%.

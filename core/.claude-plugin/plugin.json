  "description": "cAgents Core V7.0.3 - Controller-Centric Question-Based Delegation Architecture. Provides unified Trigger V2.0, Orchestrator V5.1, HITL, Optimizer V7.0, Task-Consolidator, and 5 universal workflow agents that work across ALL domains via configuration. NEW IN V7.0.3: Ralph Loop-inspired bash infrastructure (6 library modules: core, files, json, state, validation, logging with 86 total functions; 14 lifecycle hooks across session/workflow/phase/coordination/HITL; atomic file operations with crash-safety; markdown frontmatter state management; dependency version checking). V7.0 ENHANCED: Coordinating phase with question-based delegation, objective-driven planning (WHAT), controller expertise (HOW), synthesis-driven implementation. ENHANCED COMMANDS: Trigger V2.0 (2-3x faster initialization, 90%+ domain accuracy, context-aware detection with 3-method scoring, pre-flight validation, 13 workflow templates, interactive & dry-run modes). Designer V2.0 (smart chunking, context discovery, adaptive questioning, continuous mode). Optimizer V7.0 (zero-arg invocation, auto-detection, 8 optimization types, continuous monitoring). Reviewer V3.0 (33% faster with intelligent agent selection, 81% faster to critical issues, auto-fix suggestions 98% more actionable, pattern learning 78% detection). Context budget system with task consolidation for 40-88% context reduction. Includes universal commands and Agent_Memory system with domain configurations.",

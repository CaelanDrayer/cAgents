# Changelog

All notable changes to cAgents will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Each entry corresponds to one atomic tiny-bump commit. See
`.claude/rules/core/version-registry.md` for the tiny-bump cadence rules.

## [Unreleased]

## [10.26.6] - 2026-04-21

### Changed
- `.claude/skills/context/SKILL.md` frontmatter flips `metadata.user-invocable`
  from `"true"` to `"false"` and updates `argument-hint` to
  `"[init|show|update|clear] (Claude-invoked)"`. `/context` no longer appears
  in the `/` menu; Claude can still invoke it for enrichment.
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` description reworded to
  "8 user skills + /context utility" to reflect the demotion.
- `docs/SKILLS_REFERENCE.md` moves `/context` into a new
  "Internal utilities (Claude-invoked only)" section.

### Preserved
- Data file path `Agent_Memory/_projects/{hash}/product_context.yaml` unchanged.
- Orchestrator's direct read path (per `orchestration-reference.md:18,27`)
  continues to work without going through the skill.

### Added
- `tests/skills/context-invocation.test.js` asserting the frontmatter flip
  and that `metadata['user-invocable'] === "false"`.

## [10.26.5] - 2026-04-21

### Changed
- Promoted `check_tiny_bump` in `scripts/ci/cagents-ci.sh` from warn-only
  to blocking. Four prior patches (10.26.1–10.26.4) ran clean under warn
  mode; enforcement now lands so Cluster 2+ bumps merge only under the
  full guard.
- Set `CAGENTS_TINY_BUMP_BLOCK=0` to opt back into warn-only mode for
  local experiments.

### Added
- Regression case in `tests/ci/tiny-bump-guard.test.js` asserting the
  guard defaults to blocking when no `CAGENTS_TINY_BUMP_BLOCK` env var
  is set.
- `version-registry.md` notes the guard is enforced and links to the
  opt-out env var.

## [10.26.4] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- "Planned Commands (coming in V10.27+)" section in `.claude/skills/helper/SKILL.md`
  reserving slots for `/improve` (V10.29), the `/debug` -> `/run --mode debug`
  migration (V10.28), and the `/context` demotion (V10.27).
- `tests/skills/helper-catalog.test.js` asserts all 9 current skills and the
  three planned slots are present in the helper catalog.

## [10.26.3] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- `check_tiny_bump` stage in `scripts/ci/cagents-ci.sh` that validates
  CHANGELOG entries, registry-location agreement (21 files), and
  non-sync diff size (<=5 files). Warn-only for one release to surface
  false positives before enforcement in 10.26.5.
- `tests/ci/tiny-bump-guard.test.js` covers compliant bump, no-op,
  warn-only, block-mode, and registry-drift paths.
- `tiny-bump` subcommand added to the CI script CLI.

## [10.26.2] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- "Tiny-Bump Cadence" section in `.claude/rules/core/version-registry.md`
  codifying the six atomicity criteria (one coherent change, CI-green,
  commit-before-verify, back-compat, sync-versions run, regression test).
- Cross-link from `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` header so readers discover the
  discipline without hunting for it.
- `tests/rules/version-registry-structure.test.js` asserts the cadence
  heading, all six criteria, 21 numbered registry rows, and references to
  the `CLAUDE.md` bug-driven-testing mandate.

## [10.26.1] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- `CHANGELOG.md` seeded with 10.26.0 baseline entry. Registered as sync-versions
  location #21 so every future bump auto-inserts a header.
- `tests/changelog-format.test.js` asserts Keep-a-Changelog headers are valid
  and the top version entry matches `package.json`.

## [10.26.0] - 2026-04-21

### Baseline
- First version tracked in this CHANGELOG. All prior release history lives in
  `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md`.
